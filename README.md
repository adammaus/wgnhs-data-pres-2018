# data-pres-2018
simple web map for our Borehole Geophysical Logs and Sediment Core data viewer.

Web map is live here: https://wgnhs.github.io/data-pres-2018/


## Development
This project requires [NodeJS 8+](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your development system. We recommend using the latest LTS version.
Recommended workflow is 
* fork the project to your personal github account
* clone your personal repository (inherently naming the remote as `origin`)
* set the canonical repository as the `upstream` remote: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:wgnhs/data-pres-2018.git`


### Setup
```
npm ci
```
After cloning the repository, bring up a terminal in the repository's root directory and run `npm ci` to download the dependencies.

### Running
```
npm start
```
The `npm start` command is configured to build the project, then serve the project 
at `http://localhost:8080/data-pres-2018/`

The server will watch for source changes and automatically refresh the browser.


### Building
```
npm run build
```
The distributable folder `dist/` can be generated by runnning `npm run build`

### Publishing GitHub Pages
```
npm run pages
```
The command `npm run pages` will build the source code, and commit the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository. It will also `push` the branch to the git remote named `origin`

## Releasing
```
npm run release
```
The command will:
* install dependencies
* run a fresh build
* version to the next `patch` version
* push the newly created commit and tag to remote `upstream`
* push ghpages content to remote `upstream`
